# PHP Open State

The Open State Project provides data on state legislative activities, including bill summaries, votes, sponsorships and state legislator information.

The PHP class is a simple wrapper class for the various API calls. It is incomplete as of today (Nov. 11, 2011).

To get started with it, open up `index.php`.
